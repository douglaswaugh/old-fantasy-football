Calculate points for a midfielder and a striker

Take percentage chance of playing in to account

Look for feature envy

Give player a reference to team

Delete Fixtures and just have Results?

Rename Results to ExpectedGoalsCalculator

Remove Count() from Results

Adjust goal and assist ratios when a previous team mate has left (calculate goals and assists from results, not team player fixture histories)

Should I only count games the player has played in for goal and assist ratios?  Might work quite nicely with % chance of playing (goal ratio of one every two games but only 10% chance of playing)
