Calculate the algorithm that I want to use

Work out expected points of players based on the probability of scores output by algorithm

------------------

So what would I need to do to get one result out of the data store (currently a csv)?
The other possibility is that the csv file isn't the right data store.  
I could transfer the data in to a more appropriate format.

Basically you would need some sort of interface that would get me the result between two teams for a particular season.
Although thinking about it the walking skelton in the GOOS book doesn't actually use the live data.
So perhaps I could create a dummy data source with just the games I was interested in?  That would derisk getting data out of a csv, but I'd still need to create something which could pull out individual matches.
Do I need to go back and have a look at the GOOS book again?
