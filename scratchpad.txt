Points for playing
Points for playing 60 mins
Take percentage chance of playing in to account (perhaps this is only defensive points after all, as the number of goals a player scores is proportional to the time they've spend on the pitch any way.)

created weighted points - start with 50% last year's points and 50% last six games
	have to run the points prediction twice (once for each of last year's fixtures, and last six fixtures)
	only have to predict the up-coming scores once using the last year's fixtures
	could write tests using last five fixtures and last two fixtures and make the split configurable

Adjust goal and assist ratios when a previous team mate has left (calculate goals and assists from results, not team player fixture histories)
