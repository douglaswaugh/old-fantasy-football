Move points calculation to a more appropriate place (all at same level of abstraction)
	- I suspect that might enable me to use DefenderPointsCalculator strategy pattern

Refactor poisson matrix to much simpler form which calculates defence points multiplier

Get rid of ifs around which is the players team and which is the opponent team

Make the same code work for another player type (goalkeeper)

Swap old points calculator for new points calculator
